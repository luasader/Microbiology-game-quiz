This is a basic study "game" for recall microbiology concepts.
Since I have a medical background and was a microbiology professor in UBA (Universidad de Buenos Aires) 
for a few years, I was always conected with creating tools for my students, for this reason I made this type of game 
or quiz app if you rather, to use a few days before their finals. 
It was fun to play it with them and in the same time to study this very difficult subject. 


The proyect starts with a basic interaction between the user and the program. 
The data is organized in tuples so it can be accesible and no chaged during the process.


Hope is enjoyable for others as well!
